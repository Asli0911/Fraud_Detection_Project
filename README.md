# Fraud_Detection_Project
Welcome to "Fraud Detection Project".    
One of the challenges in this project is the absence of domain knowledge. So without knowing what the column names are, we will only be interested in their values.    
The other one is the class frequencies of the target variable are quite imbalanced. We will implement Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network algorithms and SMOTE technique. Also visualize performances of the models using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Yellowbrick in a variety of ways.   

***An important reminder***: There is no missing value in dataset but lots of outliers. Without knowing what the columns mean, it is difficult to handle with outliers. On the other hand the fraud rows usually have outlier values. So winsorizing or logging the data set will prevent our models catch the frauds. Since the fraud rows are tend to include extreme values. The mean of fraud rows differ from non-fraud rows.    

   
Enjoy it.
