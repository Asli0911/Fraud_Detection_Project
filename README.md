# Fraud_Detection_Project
Welcome to "Fraud Detection Project". This is the last project of the Capstone Series.  One of the challenges in this project is the absence of domain knowledge. So without knowing what the column names are, you will only be interested in their values. The other one is the class frequencies of the target variable are quite imbalanced.  You will implement Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network algorithms and SMOTE technique. Also visualize performances of the models using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Yellowbrick in a variety of ways.  At the end of the project, you will have the opportunity to deploy your model by Flask API.  Before diving into the project, please take a look at the Determines and Tasks.
